## Welcome!

This is a small repo I've created to document some of the projects I've created as part of my coursework.

More details on the projects:

### Python Chess Game

This is a simplified game of chess played with only two pieces, the King and the Queen. Players can choose game boards of various sizes.

The game is played in the console. It was written entirely in Python and utilises an OOP design pattern.

File: `test_chess_puzzle.py`

The file shows the test written to cover common and edge scenarios in the game's development.

### Java Memory Game

This is a simple memory game where players need to match idential cards.

This game is played in the console. It was written entirely in Java and utilises an OOP design pattern.

Files: `Game.java`, `Tests.java`

The files show the main game and the tests written for it.

### Godot GDScript Game

This is a fairly complex real-time strategy game, where players build power plants to generate electricity for consumers.

This game is played in a GUI. It was written entirely in GDScript and utilises Entity-Component-System, Singleton, Event Driven Architecture, and Data Oriented Design patterns.

Files:

Entity-Component-System
- `SMoneySpentComponent.gd` shows the Component attached to an Entity
- `RunningCostSystem.gd` shows the System that utilises the Component

Singleton + Data Oriented Design
- `Highscores.gd`

Event Driven Architecture
- `game_manager.gd`
